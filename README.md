## 1. Project Overview

This React application is a client-side user interface that interacts with a Node.js backend to provide the following functionalities:

1. **Sum:** Calculate the sum of two numbers.
2. **Append Strings:** Combine two strings into one.
3. **Count Words:** Upload a file and count the number of words in it.

## 2. Project Structure

- `src/`: The main source code directory.
- `public/`: Static files and the `index.html` file.

## 3. Folder Structure

The `src/` directory contains the following key folders and files:

- `src/
  - `components/`: Contains React components for each functionality.
  - `App.js`: The main component that handles routing.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
  - `serviceWorker.js`: Service worker for offline capabilities.
  - `setupTests.js`: Configuration for testing.

## 4. Components

### Sum

- **Location:** `src/components/Sum.jsx`
- **Description:** This component provides a user interface for the Sum functionality. Users can input two numbers, click a button, and see the sum of the numbers.

### AppendStrings

- **Location:** `src/components/AppendStrings.jsx`
- **Description:** This component offers a user interface for the Append Strings functionality. Users can input two strings, click a button, and see the combined result.

### CountWords
